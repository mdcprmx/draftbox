sooo okay, we are doing LINUX!
here's the list of "TO DO" stuff

First, get Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04 without GUI! Like here for example
https://ubuntu.com/download/server

Second, install it on VM. Yeah, again. Do this again bruddah

Third, 

General ruurz for this project:
- create develop, I guess
- use src folder (as usual)
- report file must be in ".md" extenstion
- all quest parts must be specified as HEADER LEVEL 2, soo just use "##" for dem
- списки, юзай списки в рамках одного задания (типа красиво)
- every screenshot must have a smol NOTE! like.. saying what ta hell is on screenshot
- crop every screenshot, so only viable part is present 

Part 1:
- install Linux
- Ubuntu 20.04 Server LTS (no GUI version)
- use Oracle VirtualBox
- NO GRAPHICS ALLOWED BRUDDAH!!
- get yo Ubuntu version using command
  cat /etc/issue.
- put dis screenshot in yer report.md file brah, and a small note too



Part 2:
- create a new user, someone unique.
- add him to group "adm" (huh? does it mean root rights or what?)
- add teh screenshot of this command call (to create a user)
  basically just type:
	useradd mpx
	useradd boii
	useradd anotherUniqueGuys
also, here's a note, not rly related but nontheless:
	useradd -m -d /var/www/ravi -s /bin/bash -c "IlikeTurtles" -U regular_user_group
	-m flag creates home dir for user
	-d specifies home directory
	-s sets default shell (bash in this case)
	-c adds extra info about the user (HE LIKES TURTLESS, OH MY GOD!!!)
	-U creates a group
soo add Screenshot of this "useradd random_user_name" command to .md file

- this new user must be in da output of "cat /etc/passwd" command
- add screenshot of this output



Part 3:
- hey, you! yes, you - READ STUFF ABOUT NETWORK INTERFACES!
- and read about DHCP too u numnuck

also
- give name to the machine "user-1"
- set time zone as yours
- print names of NETWORK INTERFACES using bash command
	for example u can use commands such as "ip addr", or "ifconfig", "nmcli device status"
	or just browse thru sys/class/net, using:
	ls /sys/class/net
	
	u can also use:
	hwinfo --short --network
	sudo lshw -class network -short
	lspci | egrep -i 'network|ethernet|wireless|wi - fi'
	  Anyways, u have lots of options my man!
- screenshot this shit i guess..
- give reasoning and meaning to "interface lo" being present in words in yer report
- using another bash command get ur IP adress BUT THIS TIME - FROM DHCP server, not form yerself
	basically just type:
	dhclient (-v)
	cat /var/log/messages | grep -i 'dhcp'
	cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i 'dhcp'
- screenshot this shoit too
- give transcription to DHCP word as a point in .md
- get external ip adress, and local ip adress, thru bash command (gw adress)
	ip route 
- screenshot this shite too
- then
- set static settings for ip, gw, dns. (use public DNS servers, like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8)
- screenshot this too m8
- then REBOOT YER VM, and check if everything that you have set in previous part still stands the same. (ip, gw, dns)
- in report type everything that you did, there are SEVEN (7) points in this quest.
  using text or screenshots, or both.
- then "ping 1.1.1.1"
- also "ping ya.ru"
- and paste screenshots of these pings. THERE MUST BE "0% packet loss" line in pings


Part 4:

	hostnamectl (to view current hostname)
- add user to sudoers group
	sudo usermod -aG sudo <user>
- screenshot this

Part 6:

	date 
	date +"%Z %z"
	timedatectl

Part 7:
- bruh wtf, I must install VIM..

  and write yo name in these files (tanjaann)
	test_vim.txt
	test_nano.txt
	test_whateverName.txt
- screenshot this shoit!!!1!
- and writea report about how did u save and leave these redactors
- (yeah yeah, u cant quit VIM bruddah)
- then
- open with vim, nano, and whateverTheFockThird redactor anem is, their corresponding files, and edit them!
	edit them so there is only "21 School 21" text
- and after that - LEAVE WITHOUS SAVING!
- then screenshot this shoite m8, after REDACTING, but BEFORE LEAVING WITHOUT SAVING
